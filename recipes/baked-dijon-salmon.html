        <p>This mustard-crusted salmon is a wonderful way to prepare fresh salmon fillets in the oven.
            Be sure to make extra â€” your family will be begging for more!</p>

        <p>Buckle up, this recipe is way longer than the first one!
            But it'll be well worth it. Takes a little longer than Tuna Fish Salads, but boy it'll fill you up!</p>
        <p>Personally, I <strong>love</strong> me some salmon. I hope you'll like this recipe as much as I (and many others) do!</p>
